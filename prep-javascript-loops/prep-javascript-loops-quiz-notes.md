## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
The purpose of the condition expression is to let the loop know when to execute or stop the statement from being executed.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
The Initialization expression is evaluated before the loops begins and only happens once.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
The condition expression is evaluated before each loop iteration to make sure the expression is still true before executing the statement again.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
The final expression is evaluated at the end of each iteration's statement execution and before the next condition evaluation.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
The purpose of the final expression is to update the counter variable. This helps to stop the loop from next iteration.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
For...in loops should be used on objects and arrays.
